## Publishing Apps

To publish your apps: 

* Go to [https://www.shinyapps.io/](https://www.shinyapps.io/) and create a free
account. You can host up to 5 shiny apps. However, you only get limited server
resources dedicated to each user.
* Even better: Use the recently installed Middlebury Shiny Server Pro.





## Uploading Files to Midd Shiny Server

Mac:
* Open Finder
* Menu Bar -> Go > Connect to Server: `cifs://shiny.middlebury.edu/USERNAME`

Windows:

* Open File Explorer
* In address bar, `\\shiny.middlebury.edu\USERNAME`





## Uploading Files to Midd Shiny Server

Once logged in:

* Go into the folder `ShinyApps`
* Create a folder with the name of your Shiny App


The URL any Shiny App `APPNAME` is
* [http://shiny.middlebury.edu/USERNAME/APPNAME/](http://shiny.middlebury.edu/USERNAME/APPNAME/)
* which auto-redirects to [https://shiny.middlebury.edu:3838/USERNAME/APPNAME](https://shiny.middlebury.edu:3838/USERNAME/APPNAME)




## Installing Packages

For now, this is only way I know; I'm investigating if this can be easier.

* RStudio menu bar -> Tools -> Shell...
* Type `ssh USERNAME@shiny.middlebury.edu`
* Type `R`.
* Type `install.packages("ggplot2")` for example
* Select a CRAN mirror in the United States.
* Say yes to prompts about installing in a new library.
* After you've installed all the necessary packages, close the window.





## Today's Exercise: Publish Shiny App


First 

* Publish your app to the Middlebury server under the URL [http://shiny.middlebury.edu/USERNAME/testing/](http://shiny.middlebury.edu/USERNAME/testing/) by copying the `testing` folder into the `ShinyApps` folder on the server
* Test that you can access it from a browser.
