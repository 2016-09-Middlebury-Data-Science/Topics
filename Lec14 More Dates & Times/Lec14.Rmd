## UTC

**Coordinated Universal Time** (UTC) is the primary time standard by which the
world regulates clocks and time.

* It is within about 1 second of mean solar time at 0° longitude
* It does not observe daylight saving time. 
* It is one of several closely related successors to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).
